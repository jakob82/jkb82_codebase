# C4D FILES

This folder does currently contain a subset of 5 folders, which actually, reasemble a giant collection of cinema 4d files, which can be used as prototypes, to be iterated, and in some cases animated with VRay, and Octane Render, to generate mindblowing visual stunning imagery.

To run these files, simply install cinema 4d, download the entire repo, and copy the files, either for your content browser folder, or for your working directory.

Hope You Enjoy It
Cheers!!!
