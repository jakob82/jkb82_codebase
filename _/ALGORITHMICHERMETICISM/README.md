# ALGORITHMIC HERMETICISM

These folder contains a couple scripts, that can be used to read the tarot, the iching, and runes, and eventually coming up with a game in unity, one day, to help readign cards (or otherwise in Processing or Three.js, p5.js or something else).

```
    contents:
    stochasticCardReading.js        #   collection of following three scripts
    stochasticIchingReadings.js     #   reads iching
    stochasticRunesReadings.js      #   reads runes
    stochasticTarotReadings.js      #   reads the tarot
```

To run, simply locate and cd into the folder, then install nodejs interpreter, and simply:
-   node  stochasticTarotReadings.js

Enjoy
Cheers
