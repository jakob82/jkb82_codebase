# TMM2018 - PROCESSING SKETCHES

## tinkering with code from the community

A repository i created containing nearly one week of worthy tinkering with processing examples constining in examples from the community

Most of the sketches were not created by me from scratch. however i learned like an hell of lot out of modifying and tinkering around with them

I would like to demonstrate my gratitude towards the openprocessing community
